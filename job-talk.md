## Scaled humanity: computational scaffolds for pro-social interaction in-the-large

Can computational scaffolds unlock improved interaction? Failures to achieve collective goals are rarely caused by a lack of ability or interest — these failures increasingly stem from interpersonal friction. In this talk, I explore how computational mediation can be designed to minimize negative social behavior and support prosocial coordination. I will introduce one scaffold that improves reputation signals through peer feedback and another that studies the causes of team fracture. My work takes the position that with suitable computational scaffolds, we can design interactions enabeling us to thrive together.
