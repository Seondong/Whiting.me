## Frequently asked questions

### Can we talk?
Perhaps — I am reducing meetings due to a tight schedule. [Email me](mailto:mark@whiting.me) your question and a phone number at which I can reach you. I'll probably respond via email, but if it makes more sense, I'll call.

### Can I have your CV?
Yes — my [CV is here](https://whiting.me/cv). It's printer friendly and can be used to save a PDF.

### How can I get a letter of recommendation?
1. Do research with me.  
2. At least 2 weeks before the application deadline, [email me](mailto:mark@whiting.me?subject=Recommendation request) the details of the application and deadline, your application essays, your CV and an informal paragraph about our work together. Use this to let me know if there's anything you'd like the letter to highlight. It's fine to ask me what kind of letter I will write for you.
3. I'll let you know when I submit the letter, but if you don't hear from me by the day before the deadline, feel free to email me as many times as you want.
