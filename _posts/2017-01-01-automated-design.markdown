To automate design, the nuances of design decisions need to be represented computationally. This is challenging because even humans often don't agree on the decisions going into a design. In my PhD, I introduced an automatic, grammar-based system for structuring design information <a class="button smallCaps" href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44989-0_15" >DCC'16</a>, and showed how it could be applied to design problems <a class="button smallCaps" href="http://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060417000464">AI EDAM</a>.
