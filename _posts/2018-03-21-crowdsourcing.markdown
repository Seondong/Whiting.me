Crowdsourcing tools today offer ad hoc and remote work arrangements at an unprecedented scale, yet many of the perks of traditional jobs have not yet been realized for this community. The <a href="http://crowdresearch.stanford.edu" >Stanford Crowd Research Collective</a> developed <a href="http://www.daemo.org" >Daemo</a> <a class="button smallCaps" href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/crowdguilds/CSCWDemo.pdf" >CSCW'17</a>, a crowdsourcing platform aiming to mitigate many of these challenges. For example we introduced crowd guilds <a class="button smallCaps" href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/crowdguilds/guilds.pdf" >CSCW'17</a>, to improve reputation and feedback within crowdsourcing, inspired by traditional worker guilds, <a href="https://crowdresearch.github.io/open-gov/constitution/2016/11/21/constitution.html" >Daemo Constitution</a> <a class="button smallCaps" href="http://collectiveintelligenceconference.org" >CI'17</a>, to give workers and requesters agency in platform governance, boomerang <a class="button smallCaps" href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2016/boomerang/boomerang-uist.pdf" >UIST'16</a>, to incentivize honest feedback, and prototype tasks <a class="button smallCaps" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05645.pdf" >HCOMP'17</a>, to fix tasks before they launch.
