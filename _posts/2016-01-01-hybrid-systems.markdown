Humans are pretty good at chess, computers are better, humans and computers together have been even better. However, we are still not very good at getting the best out of this kind of working relationship. Mentoring undergraduate students at CMU and in the <a href="http://www.sis.pitt.edu/i3/" >Pitt i3</a>, we built systems to encourage humans and computers to work together. For example, we explored how socio-technical systems can provide novel insight into new product development opportunities, by performing computational analysis on Amazon product reviews <a class="button smallCaps" href="http://ischools.org/the-iconference/about-the-iconference/iconference-2016-summary/" >iCONF'16</a>, and we studied how hybrid tools can help researchers get started with crowdsourcing faster <a class="button smallCaps" href="http://ischools.org/the-iconference/" >iCONF'18</a>.
